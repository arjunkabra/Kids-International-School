<p>kids International School is a highly collaborative, joyful school where every student is known well and appreciated for their unique attributes. Committed to instilling in our students a love for learning and an appreciation for intelligence in its multiple forms, our talented faculty provides an outstanding educational experience that equips students with a strong academic foundation and valuable life skills. We employ a constructivist philosophy to allow students to continually reflect on their own learning, pose their own questions, and pursue answers in a structured, but personalized environment.</p>

<p>At Kids International School, we strive to reach our goals through student-centered instructional approaches, cooperative, project-based learning activities, and an integration of the arts into the core curriculum. Children at all grade levels are guided to make connections about what they learn to the world around them. Throughout the year, students have the chance to showcase their work and talents in performances and exhibits in and around Tumkur.</p>
